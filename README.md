## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, focusing on understanding data in various business scenarios. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process, providing insights that inform decisions and strategies.

## Key Techniques

### 1. Business Understanding
   - Defining objectives and constraints for the analysis to ensure relevant insights are derived.

### 2. Data Understanding
   - Analyzing data types: 
     - Ordinal
     - Nominal
     - Interval
     - Ratio

### 3. Auto EDA
   - Utilizing automated tools to perform EDA efficiently, revealing initial insights quickly.

### 4. Outlier Analysis
   - Identifying and analyzing outliers to understand their impact on data quality and insights.

### 5. Descriptive Analytics
   - Summarizing data sets to uncover patterns and trends through descriptive statistics.

### 6. Handling Missing Values
   - Techniques for identifying and imputing missing data to maintain data integrity.

###   7. Data Transformation
   - Applying techniques like min-max scaling and standardization to prepare data for analysis.

### 8. Data Encoding
   - Implementing encoding techniques such as:
     - Dummy Variable Creation
     - One-Hot Encoding
     - Label Encoding
     - Handling zero variance features

## Technologies Used
